            The current landing page is limited in terms of the content
            available on the dav.org website. Notably, there are no individual
            articles on this page, and the scope of any previous magazine
            content is missing. Clicking on any of the links directs the user to
            a third-party site that presents a PDF layout. This limitation
            restricts the SEO and searchability of dav.org, which is a stated
            objective of this project to address.

          <p class="mb-5 leading-8">
            This involved reviewing the latest magazines with the team
            responsible for their creation and production. All content was
            categorized and discussed in detail, considering how each piece
            could be integrated into the website. Questions such as "Could
            anything be left out?", "What should we do with this section?", and
            "How can we incorporate articles from the earliest magazines?" were
            thoroughly explored as a team. Current magazines were analyzed to
            determine their flow and identify any potential similarities that
            could be replicated on the website. The stakeholders expressed their
            preference for websites like https://www.theatlantic.com and
            https://www.nytimes.com, and inquired if the new landing page layout
            could be designed to have a similar aesthetic.
          </p>
          <p class="mb-2 font-semibold !text-black">
            It was determined that all magazine articles had to fit within one
            of these categories:
          </p>
          <ul class="list-disc list-inside leading-loose mb-5">
            <li>Veteran Stories</li>
            <li>Commentaries</li>
            <li>Service Spotlight</li>
            <li>Letters</li>
            <li>Legislative Spotlight</li>
            <li>Staff Appointments</li>
            <li>Reflections</li>
            <li>In Remembrance</li>
          </ul>

          <p class="mb-2 leading-8">
            Although all articles could stand on their own, there was still a
            desire to connect to them with the magazine issue. So each article
            would not only have one category (listed above) tied to them, but
            also a magazine edition tag (example: November | December 2025
            Edition) would be required as well.

            The solution I came up with was to have a landing page that would
            house the most recent content, structured by category, with the
            option for a "featured" post and a "highlighted" post that would
            have more prominent content. From there users can navigate to
            individual posts, archives based on category, an inquiry form to
            reach out to a DAV representative, and a magazine download archives
            page.

            few others to build out the landing page.
